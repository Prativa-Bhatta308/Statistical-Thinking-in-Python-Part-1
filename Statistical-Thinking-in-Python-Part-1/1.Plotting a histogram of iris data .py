Plotting a histogram of iris data
For the exercises in this section, you will use a classic data set collected by botanist Edward Anderson and made famous by Ronald Fisher, one of the most prolific statisticians in history. Anderson carefully measured the anatomical properties of samples of three different species of iris, Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The full data set is available as part of scikit-learn. Here, you will work with his measurements of petal length.

Plot a histogram of the petal lengths of his 50 samples of Iris versicolor using matplotlib/seaborn's default settings. Recall that to specify the default seaborn style, you can use sns.set(), where sns is the alias that seaborn is imported as.

The subset of the data set containing the Iris versicolor petal lengths in units of centimeters (cm) is stored in the NumPy array versicolor_petal_length.

In the video, Justin plotted the histograms by using the pandas library and indexing the DataFrame to extract the desired column. Here, however, you only need to use the provided NumPy array. Also, Justin assigned his plotting statements (except for plt.show()) to the dummy variable _. This is to prevent unnecessary output from being displayed. It is not required for your solutions to these exercises, however it is good practice to use it. Alternatively, if you are working in an interactive environment such as a Jupyter notebook, you could use a ; after your plotting statements to achieve the same effect. Justin prefers using _. Therefore, you will see it used in the solution code.

Instructions
Import matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn as their usual aliases (plt and sns).
Use seaborn to set the plotting defaults.
Plot a histogram of the Iris versicolor petal lengths using plt.hist() and the provided NumPy array versicolor_petal_length.
Show the histogram using plt.show().

# Import matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn as their usual aliases (plt and sns).
# Use seaborn to set the plotting defaults.
# Plot a histogram of the Iris versicolor petal lengths using plt.hist() and the provided NumPy array versicolor_petal_length.
# Show the histogram using plt.show().



# Import plotting modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set default Seaborn style
sns.set()

# Plot histogram of versicolor petal lengths
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length)

# Show histogram
plt.show() 



Axis labels!
In the last exercise, you made a nice histogram of petal lengths of Iris versicolor, but you didn't label the axes! That's ok; it's not your fault since we didn't ask you to. Now, add axis labels to the plot using plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel(). Don't forget to add units and assign both statements to _. The packages matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn are already imported with their standard aliases. This will be the case in what follows, unless specified otherwise.
Instructions
Label the axes. Don't forget that you should always include units in your axis labels. Your -axis label is just 'count'. Your -axis label is 'petal length (cm)'. The units are essential!
Display the plot constructed in the above steps using plt.show().

# Plot histogram of versicolor petal lengths
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length)

# Label axes
plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
plt.ylabel('count')

# Show histogram
plt.show()

Adjusting the number of bins in a histogram
The histogram you just made had ten bins. This is the default of matplotlib. The "square root rule" is a commonly-used rule of thumb for choosing number of bins: choose the number of bins to be the square root of the number of samples. Plot the histogram of Iris versicolor petal lengths again, this time using the square root rule for the number of bins. You specify the number of bins using the bins keyword argument of plt.hist().

The plotting utilities are already imported and the seaborn defaults already set. The variable you defined in the last exercise, versicolor_petal_length, is already in your namespace.
Instructions
Import numpy as np. This gives access to the square root function, np.sqrt().
Determine how many data points you have using len().
Compute the number of bins using the square root rule.
Convert the number of bins to an integer using the built in int() function.
Generate the histogram and make sure to use the bins keyword argument.
Hit submit to plot the figure and see the fruit of your labors!

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Compute number of data points: n_data
n_data = len(versicolor_petal_length)

# Number of bins is the square root of number of data points: n_bins
n_bins = np.sqrt(n_data)

# Convert number of bins to integer: n_bins
n_bins = int(n_bins)


# Plot the histogram
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length, bins=n_bins)

# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('count')

# Show histogram
plt.show()
